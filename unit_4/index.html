	<h3>Who am I?</p>
	<p id="aboutme">
		I left Brazil in 2011 to study Economics and Political Science in London. Following a year of work in Paris, I completed a Masters in Finance in the Netherlands and moved to Berlin, where I have been working and living ever since. After having left Brazil I realised how difficult it was to keep up with what was happening in the country by following Brazilian news outlets, so I switched to seeing Brazil from the outside in. After many happy years of reading what are often much more complete and impartial news pieces from foreign outlets, and seeing how the journalistic failures in Brazil had contributed to mass disinformation, suspicions and distrust, through this page I offer you the solution I found to accessing reliable information.
